        <p>As technology starts growing we need to update ourselves to current trends and our upcoming generations looking forward for necessary services in one touch. The current system of applying or renewing for bus pass is a tedious process. It takes long time for taking bus passes it involves a long queue in Depo and it is a time consuming process.Our project is created to provide timesaving, comfortable and
          safe services for stuents. Due to the drawbacks that are present in
          the existing system, we got the idea of doing this project of
          generating the buspass through online which can help students in
          a better way. In the existing system student had to do each and
          every process manually, but our project helps student to make
          their work faster and easy. Students can buy the bus pass through
          the internt. This system is also used the to save the students time.
          The students can pay to buy bus pass through online.</p>
